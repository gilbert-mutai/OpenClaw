We are resuming the OpenClaw WhatsApp + Mattermost project. Please read README.md and SETUP_RUNBOOK.md in the repo, then continue from Step 11 (Dynamic responses + scheduled follow-ups). Implement the professional WhatsApp response, structured Mattermost messages with @here, urgency detection (urgent vs normal), and follow-ups at 30 min (urgent) / 60 min (normal) using OpenClaw skills/cron.
